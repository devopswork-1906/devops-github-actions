This example demonstrates how to deploy a production-grade AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) with multiple listeners, ACM certificates, Auto Scaling Groups, and target groups. It covers common real-world use cases, including HTTPS termination, multiple certificates, target group routing, and integration with both Auto Scaling Groups and standalone instances. Also, it has multiple listener role to route traffic based on conditions defined.

## Features

This example provisions:
- ACM Certificates
  - Primary certificate for the ALB.
  - Additional certificate for multi-domain support.

  - Multiple conditions for listner rule lile http_header, query_string, path_pattern, host_header, source_ip, http_request_method, routing.
- Target Groups
  - Auto Scaling Group (ASG) of EC2 instances (dynamic backend).
  - Standalone EC2 instances (static backend).
  - Health checks configured per TG.
  - Additional target group attachmennt
- Auto Scaling
  - Launch template and ASG.
  - Scaling policies (CPU target scaling).
  - Example lifecycle policies.
- Outputs
  - ALB DNS name.
